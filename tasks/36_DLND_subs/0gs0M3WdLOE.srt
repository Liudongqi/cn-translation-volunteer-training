00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,810
Hey there.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,940
I really hope you're enjoying the first week
of the program.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,600
I just wanted to give you a little preview
of what's coming up,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,500
so you have a better idea of what you'll be
doing.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,880
Next week, Louise will be showing you how
we can tell

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,170
if our networks are learning what we want
them to learn.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,620
We do this through what's called validation.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,700
We test the network on a subset of the data,
to see how well they're performing.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,131
After that, Andrew Trask, author of grokking
Deep Learning

10
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:28,818
and a general deep learning expert,

11
00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:30,890
will lead you through building the networks

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,490
that can predict if a movie review is positive
or negative.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,480
Then, we'll be learning about convolutional
networks,

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,680
these networks are able to identify objects
and images.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,470
You'll be using them in the second project,
where you'll be classifying images based on

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,460
objects
that are hidden in those images.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,900
After that, we'll be covering recurrent neural
networks.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,530
This is a network architecture that can learn
information

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,090
about how the data is sequenced.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,230
For example, which word comes next in a sentence.

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,390
You can do awesome things with these,
like generate text with music,

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,729
and achieve state-of-the-art results in natural
language processing.

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,229
Finally, we'll get into unsupervised learning,
that is networks that learn only from the

24
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,270
data itself.

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,329
Specifically, you'll be learning about generative
adversarial networks,

26
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,619
also known as GANs.

27
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,310
GANs are the major advancement in deep learning,
allowing networks to understand data better

28
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,319
than anything
we've used before.

29
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,279
The inventor of GANs - Even Goodfellow - will
teach you

30
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,659
how to build and train these awesome Deep
Learning Network.

31
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,810
Thanks so much for enrolling in this program,
it's a pleasure for all of us to be teaching

32
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,149
you.

33
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,640
Deep learning is the future of artificial
intelligence,

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,020
and this is your first step in the new world.

35
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,640
See you in class.
