Imagine you work for a production company,

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:06,200
and your job is to write a script 
for one of their television shows.

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,333
You could write the script manually or

4
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,100
you could just have a computer do it for you.

5
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:15,633
In the third project, you'll generate a TV script 
using a recurrent neural network.

6
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,100
You'll train the network on existing scripts,

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,900
then use it to generate an original piece of writing.

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,467
Good luck and happy scripting.
