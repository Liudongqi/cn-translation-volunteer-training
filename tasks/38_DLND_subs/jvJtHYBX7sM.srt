Imagine you work
for a production company,

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,150
and your job is to design
the characters in a movie.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,850
You would usually draw a
bunch of different concepts

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,459
before arriving at
the final design.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,120
What if you had a neural network
that could do this for you?

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,339
Maybe the lead character
needs to be "gritty."

7
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,190
No-- what about "above the law"?

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,580
That's better.

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,759
How about "above the law scifi"?

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, that's the one.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,199
You'll build a generative
adversarial network

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,909
that's not far off.

13
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,219
In this project,
you'll build a GAN

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,259
that will generate new faces
using celebrity images.

15
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:40,939
Have fun!
