1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,300
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,580
You're one project
away from graduating.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,339
We've gone through a lot.

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,279
We started with learning the
basics of neural networks.

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,619
We covered convolutional
neural networks

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,829
to solve vision problems.

7
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,570
You used recurrent networks
to generate new text

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,629
and translate between languages.

9
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:20,129
Now you'll be using GANs
to generate new images.

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,369
We hoped you had
fun, and we can't

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,210
wait to see what you'll
do in the future.
